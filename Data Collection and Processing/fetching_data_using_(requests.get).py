# In Python, thereâ€™s a module available, called requests. You can use the get function in the requests module to fetch the contents of a page.

import requests
import json

page = requests.get("https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=funny")
print(type(page)) # this is a Response object from the request class
print(page.text[:150]) # print the first 150 characters
print(page.url) # print the url that was fetched

print("------")
x = page.json() # turn page.text into a python object
# It is something like x = jason.loads(page.text)

print(type(x))
print("---first item in the list---")
print(x[0])
print("---the whole list, pretty printed---")
print(json.dumps(x, indent=2)) # pretty print the results
