#### Nested List Phenomenon:
#### [This is the [This is the nested list] outer list]

print([10, 20, 30][1]) => It will create a list of [10, 20, 30] and then print out the 2nd item of that list.

List assignment statement replaces the value at the designated position with the assigned value.

#### JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.
It originated with JavaScript. But, Python makes it pretty easy to both read in and write out data in JSON format. In fact, JSON format looks almost exactly like the printout of a Python list or a dictionary. 

#### Dump S => dumps(), dumps an object to a string. Load S => loads(), loads an object from a string in JSON. JSON dot Load S => json.loads(), loads from a string into a Python object either a list or a dictionary, and JSON dot dump S => json.dumps(), dumps from a Python list or dictionary into a string.
